# SENTIMENT_CLASSIFIER

A sentiment classifier on the IMDB 50k dataset. It involves: 1) Data Preprocessing to clean the text data (e.g., removing URLs, punctuation, and stop words). 2) Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation: Training and evaluating Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifiers, comparing their performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and support. 3) Deep Learning Model Training and Evaluation: Training and evaluating LSTM and CNN models for sentiment analysis, again comparing their performance using the same metrics. 4) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting exploratory analysis on the dataset to understand its characteristics, including visualizing data distributions, analyzing review lengths, and identifying frequent words. 5) Topic Modeling: Applying either BERT or LDA to discover underlying topics within the movie reviews. Finally, the task involves visualizing the results, potentially mapping the identified topics to genres like "sad," "romantic," and "happy" based on the words associated with each topic. This comprehensive approach aims to build robust sentiment analysis models, compare their performance, and gain deeper insights into the underlying themes and genres within the movie reviews.
